Created a calulator application, which demostrates TU-Dublins Coding Standards, 
Unit tests which follow a strict Test-Driven development approach with our use of version control through 
branching and merging techniques.

TDD is broken down into the three different steps:
1.	Write a test which is based on your logic and ensure that the correct behaviour is produced. In a Unit test, this involves asserting the return value of a function or verifying the test data was called as expected. 
2.	Ensure that your current test passes by implementing minimal code. Re-Check all tests to ensure the implemented code hasnâ€™t broke any tests. 
3.	Refactor the implemented code using the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Cycle to update or rewrite the implementation, without breaking the current tests
